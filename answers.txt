If you're in an online learning environment or using an educational platform with its own submission system, you'll usually find a place to upload files. It's like finding a button or a dedicated section for that purpose. Just follow the platform's instructions to submit your files.

Another option is to bundle all the important files, like the .sql and answers.txt, into a compressed file, such as a ZIP or RAR. Once you create this file, you can send it via email or use file-sharing platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox, or even through the submission system itself if it allows that.

If it's not possible to send all the files together, you can send them individually. It's like sending each .sql file and the answers.txt separately, either through email or via a file-sharing platform.

Oh, and in some cases, if you're working in a terminal, you can use command-line commands to send the files. For instance, using 'submit50' (if available) or other terminal commands to upload everything to an online repository, if the system permits it.
